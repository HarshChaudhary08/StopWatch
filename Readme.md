## Functioning

* **Starting the Stopwatch**: When the user clicks the "Start" button, the stopwatch begins counting the elapsed time. The initial time is set to zero, and the stopwatch starts incrementing the time continuously.

* **Pausing the Stopwatch**: The user can pause the stopwatch at any time by clicking the "Pause" button. When the stopwatch is paused, it stops incrementing the time, but it retains the current elapsed time on display.

* **Resuming the Stopwatch**: If the stopwatch is paused, the user can resume it by clicking the "Start" button. The stopwatch will continue incrementing the time from where it left off.

* **Resetting the Stopwatch**: The user can reset the stopwatch by clicking the "Reset" button. This action sets the elapsed time back to zero and stops the stopwatch from further incrementing until it is started again.
